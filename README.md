# Sorting Algorithm
This repository is about some common sorting algorithm.

## Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It repeatedly iterates through the array, comparing two adjacent elements at a time and swapping them if they are in the wrong order, until no more swaps are needed, which means the array has been sorted.

Although bubble sort is easy to understand and complement, it is a less efficent algorithm. In the worst case, the time complexity of bubble sort is $O(n^2)$
